>
> If you are using the virtual machine described in [Infrastructure page](./infrastructure.md) the repo is already
cloned. 
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/linux  # or navigate to the location where you cloned the repo
> git pull origin main
> ```
>
> Make sure you are on the correct branch (that is `main` branch).
>
> ### If You Do Not Have the Repository Yet
>
> If you haven't cloned the repository yet, you can do so with the following commands:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Linux-Kernel-Summer-School/linux.git
> cd linux
> ```
>
> Navigate to `drivers/lkss/labs/lab3/` lab directory to begin your work.

### Exercise 1: Writing a Simple GPIO Button Driver

In this exercise, you'll explore a basic GPIO button driver that registers an interrupt handler
when the button is pressed. This example demonstrates how to use GPIO descriptors and platform
drivers in the Linux kernel.

1. **Understand the Driver Structure**
   Explore the code under `drivers/lkss/labs/lab3/gpio_button.c`. This driver requests a GPIO line,
   converts it to an IRQ, and sets up an interrupt handler triggered on a falling edge.
   Read through `gpio_button.c` and identify the following:
    - How the GPIO is retrieved using `devm_gpiod_get()`
    - How the GPIO is mapped to an IRQ using `gpiod_to_irq()`
    - How the interrupt is requested with `devm_request_irq()`
    - Where and how the interrupt handler is defined.
  Pay special attention to the `button_irq_handler()` function. You'll implement functionality in it.
